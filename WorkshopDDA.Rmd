## Introduction

This is an R Markdown document to introduce you to R and Rstudio. (For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>).

To learn more about R and Rstudio go to QickR clicking this link:

##### Computer code (above) will lead to an action on the screen (below) looking like this:

```{r}
print("this is code")
```



##### Below is text explaining what happend: 

You called the function $print$ and it printed the string between the brackets. Try printing hello world..., note what is printed needs to be between the brackets and if it is a string in double quotation marks.

## First Step: Calculating something

```{r}
# Commenting
# Simple calculations
5+5
6^2
2^8
2.4 * 4.5
3/5
(3+3)* 4+5

# Square Root
sqrt(4) 
```

## Second Step: Generating Data

```{r}
# a sequence
1:10

# Assigning (putting numbers into) variables
a<- 4
b<-5
a*b
c <- 1:10
# c
```

## Third Step: Your workspace

```{r}
getwd() # print the current working directory - cwd 
ls()    # list the objects in the current workspace

# Set your working directory

# setwd("C:/Users/Micheal/Dropbox/Professional/Teaching and presentations/ASA-IARS-PGA/seminar/Doing Data Analysis/WorkshopDDA")
```

## Fourth Step: saving and loading data

```{r}

#Save your workspace
save(a, b, c, file = "mydata.Rdata")

# Clean workspace
rm(list=ls())

# Load your saved data
load("mydata.Rdata")
```

## Fifth Step: Different data types
