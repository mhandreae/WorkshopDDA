##### Computer code (above) will lead to an action on the screen (below) looking like this:

```{r}
print("this is code")
```



##### Below is text explaining what happend: 

You called the function $print$ and it printed the string between the brackets. Try printing hello world..., note what is printed needs to be between the brackets and if it is a string in double quotation marks.

## First Step: Calculating something

```{r}
# Commenting
# Simple calculations
5+5
6^2
2^8
2.4 * 4.5
3/5
(3+3)* 4+5

# Square Root
sqrt(4) 
```

## Second Step: Generating Data

```{r}
# a sequence
1:10

# Assigning (putting numbers into) variables
a<- 4
b<-5
a*b
c <- 1:10
# c
```

## Third Step: Your workspace ty

```{r}
getwd() # print the current working directory - cwd 
ls()    # list the objects in the current workspace
```

## Different data types
